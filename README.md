# noadpad
No-Ad-Pad is a simple add-free notes app for Android. In addition to the core note-taking functionalities, 
I've decided to include some fairly uncommon features for an Android notes app, including:

- self sorting collections: you can create collections add add a list of tags to each.
 The app will automatically parse your note files' text for tags, adding each note 
 file to an appropriate user-defined collection.
 
- script-like Java interpreter: this app makes use of the Beanshell Java Interpreter. This turns 
it into an appealing tool for quick back-of-the-envelope scripting on the run, for example: 
to analyze a string of text in your notes, or to perform some quick calculation with Java's rich Math "library".
